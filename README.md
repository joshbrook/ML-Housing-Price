# Housing Price Prediction

The purpose of this project is to experiment with, and make improvements to a basic ML model. 

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to evaluate how big of an improvement has been made.

All the code, which contains explanitory commments, can be found [here](main.py)

## Requirements
- At least 1 method to scale or normalise the data & target variable
- Use different columns in the data to predict median house value
- Try different models, and compare their performance with linear regression
- Try different values for hyper parameters (if your model has any) to see if they influence the MSE
- Find and make use of a method to add the non-numeric features as input to your model
- Combine all your changes, experiments, and improvements into your 'final' model, and reduce MSE by as much as possible
